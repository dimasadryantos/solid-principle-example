## 🧑‍🔬 Hi everyone this is my SOLID Principles example with explaination inside the project


## 👾 What is SOLID Principle ?

- **SOLID** Principles are object oriented design concepts relevant to development
- **SOLID** is acronym for five other class design principle :


 
  1.**Single Responsesibility Principle** : Each class should be responsible for single part or functionality of the system
  
  2.**Open Close Principle** : Open for extension , close for modification
  
  3.**Liskov Substitution** : Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses , without breaking the system
  
  4.**Interface Segegration** : No client should be force to depend on methods that is does not use
  
  5.**Depedency Inversion** : High level modules should not depend on low level modules , both should depend on abstraction
  
  
## 🧑🏻‍🍳 Why do we need to understand SOLID Principles ? 
  
  
 1.SOLID is structured design approach that ensures your software is modular and easy to maintain,understand,debug and refactor 🤖
 
 2.SOLID also help seve time and effort in both development and maintentance 🦾
 
 3.SOLID prevents you code from becoming rigid and fragile 🚑
